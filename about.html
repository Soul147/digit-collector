Okay, so first the obvious. Little to nothing in this game is my own idea. Most of it is adapted froma projecdoc made by Aarex (a.k.a. "The guy who made NG+3 and approximately 123708351029325709874 other games") to have a game similar to another game called "World Restoration" with an obscene amount of prestige layers. You can find this document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16d209XYjMBmLY885VH0BYFQ6Rs_EBcoL7Sl886pmTRc/edit#">here</a>. I've only made some changes such as nerfing things that I think are too over-powered.<br>
So why am I coding this thing? Well, it's simple - I wanted to help reduce the number of things Aarex is working on by 1. So if he ever does decide to work on this game, he'll have a large part of the start done for him.<br>
Other credits go to:
<ul>
<li>Aarex: Idea maker, has helped code a few things here and there</li>
<li>Soul Destroyer: Helping me out with the UI and other issues. Without this some things would have taken far longer to do.</li>
<li>PigOlympus: Various suggestions (including what D.I.G.I.T.S. stands for)</li>
<li>Probably some others I'm forgetting that have reported bugs etc.</li>
</ul>
